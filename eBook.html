    <h2><em>Learning to draw</em></h2>
    <p>This ebook is being made with total affection by me, with my drawing skills, I hope to help you with what I know. I am not a professional and no xpert on the subject.</br>
    <!--Below I present you my drawings from the beginning to today.--></p>
    <p><h4 style="color: chocolate">What encouraged me to make this eBook?</h4>
            For sure in the world was the difficulty of learning to draw when I was little. I always loved art, drawing, paintings and I was horrible! I was looking for drawing courses, but it was always very expensive, I couldn't do many things at the time to learn. so I gradually turned around, and I admit that at the beginning it was very difficult for you to want to draw something and not come out the way you expected ... not to mention the patience to continue, but I didn't give up and I hope you don't either!
            So I had empathy, when it comes to learning how to draw, I remember all my tragedy and I know how these people feel. </br>
            So, I will teach some things, as I was going slowly, ways of pituras, something very mister maker and art attack kkkkkk.</p>
